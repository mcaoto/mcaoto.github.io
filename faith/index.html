            <p>We believe in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament as equally inspired by God and inerrant in the original writings, and that they are the supreme and final authority in faith and life.
            </p>
            <p>We believe in one God: eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, manifesting Himself in Three Persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) one in nature, attributes, power and glory. God is the Sustainer of all things and the Source of all truth.
            </p>
            <p>We believe in the pre-existence, incarnation, virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, substitutionary death, bodily resurrection, ascension to heaven, and second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that He is true God and true man.
            </p>
            <p>We believe in the literal account of creation and that the Scriptures clearly and distinctly teach that the creation of man lies in the special, immediate, and formative acts of God; that man sinned and thereby incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death which is separation from God; and that all human beings are born with a sinful nature.
            </p>
            <p>We believe in the fall of man, His need for regeneration by the operation of the Holy Spirit on the basis of grace and faith alone, and the coming resurrection of the dead.
            </p>
            <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice, and rose again for our justification; that all who believe in Him are justified on the grounds of His shed blood and are saved by grace through faith wholly apart from human merit and works.
            </p>
            <p>We believe in the spiritual relationship of all believers as they are related to Jesus Christ, living an overcoming life of true righteousness by the grace and power of the Holy Spirit. The Christian relates to life from a Biblical perspective and is not conformed to societyâ€™s lifestyles and values. Therefore, we believe in the sanctity of life upon conception (Psalm 139) and that transgender, homosexuality, polygamy, and premarital and extramarital sexual relationships are not acceptable lifestyles (1 Corinthians 6).
            </p>
            <p>We believe that all who receive, by faith, the Lord Jesus are born again by the Holy Spirit through the Word of God, and thereby become children of God. Therefore, we are not in agreement with the teachings of Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses, Unitarians, New Age, Christian Science, Scientology, or any cults or secular groups that do not accept the Biblical Jesus Christ as their Savior or who use books besides the Bible as part of their doctrinal faith.
