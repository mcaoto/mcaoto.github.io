            <h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>
            <p>We meet every Tuesday afternoon from 12:30PM-4:30PM, September through the end of April. We provide classes that are parent taught nursery through high school. We see high value in our children being able to learn from other parents/teachers, and joining with other children in a fun, interactive, and challenging classroom setting.</p>
            
            <p>We offer classes in art, music, PE, history, science, and writing along with a variety of electives for high school students. The curriculum we use is biblically based. Our classes focus on group activities and projects to add a classroom element to enhance our student's homeschool experience.</p>
