    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p>We come together once a week in the afternoon for three hours to teach and learn.
        Our classes include Science, History, Art and Music for 1st through 6th grades.
        <strike>We will have History, Science and Art for Preschool and Kindergarten.</strike>
        We will also provide a nursery for infants and toddlers.
        Each class is parent taught with an assistant teacher and coordinator.
        One parent from each family must be present each week to help in some way from teaching, to handing out snacks
        or grading papers.
        We will run a background check on all adults involved.
        Classes will start in September and end in April with December and Spring Break off.</p>

    <p>When we meet each week, we intend to start with an assembly where everyone gathers together first
    for any kind of announcements and then children will be split off into classes. After all classes are over
    everyone will assemble again together to conclude the day.</p>
    <p>We want our children to be able to experience what it is like learning from different people, and to be able
    to join with other children that are all trying to learn the same things. We want our children to see that everyone
    is unique, and may have a different approach towards life, but that we all face a lot of the same challenges.</p>
    <p>As parents, there are some areas we aren't as skilled at communicating to our kids in a way that they can
    understand it, and finding other parents that may be able to teach something from a different perspective may allow
    for that understanding to be more easily grasped.</p>
    <p>We keep the costs as low as possible for all the various things involved so you don't have to pay much.</p>
