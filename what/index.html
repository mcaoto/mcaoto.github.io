    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p>We come together once a week from 12:30-4 to teach and learn. We have Science, History, Art and Music for 1st
        through 6th grades. We will have History, Science and Art for Preschool and Kindergarten. We will also provide
        a nursery for infants and toddlers. Each class is parent taught with an assistant teacher. One parent from each
        family must be present each week to help in some way. We will run a background check on all adults involved.
        From teaching, to handing out snacks or grading papers. Classes will start in September and end in April with
        December and Spring Break off.</p>
