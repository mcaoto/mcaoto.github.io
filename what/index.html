            <h3>Weekly Meetings</h3>
            <p>We come together once a week on Tuesday afternoon from 12:30PM-4:00PM. We start with an assembly and then
                children are dismissed to their classes which include Science, History, Art and Music for 1st through
                12th grades. We have Bible, Science and Art for Preschool and Kindergarten. We also provide a nursery for
                infants and toddlers. Each class is parent taught with an assistant teacher and room coordinator. One parent
                from each family must be present each week to help in some way from teaching, to handing out snacks to grading
                papers. We run a background check on all participating adults. Classes run September thru April with a Winter
                and Spring break.</p>

            <p>We see high value in our children being able to learn from other parents/teachers, and joining with
                other children in a fun, interactive, and challenging classroom setting.
            </p>

            <p>We work very hard to provide an affordable resource for homeschool families in our community.
