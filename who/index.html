            <h1>Who We Are</h1>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>To support homeschooling families by encouraging purposeful relationships, life skills, and providing
                educational opportunities with a Biblical worldview.
            </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>We are an academic cooperative community of home school parents and students. Our goal is to give homeschool
                families a safe and fun place to come once a week and learn together. A place where parents use their gifts,
                skills, and strengths to the teach our children life long skills. We as parents can gain encouragement and
                support from one another. Our children have the opprutunity to learn from other teaching styles and grow in
                their ability to learn.</p>
