    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>We are an academic cooperative community of home school parents and students. Our goal is to give homeschool
        families a safe and fun place to come once a week and learn together. A place where parents use their gift,
        skills and strengths to the teach the children life long skills. We as parents can gain encouragement and
        support from one another. Our children have the opprutunity to learn from other teaching styles and grow in
        their ability to learn.</p>
